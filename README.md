4. **Synthesis**: Comprehensive analysis and summary
5. **Follow-up**: Generate research questions and recommendations

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the files**
2. **Install dependencies**:
3. **Set up your Google API key**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```python
from main import DeepResearchAssistant

# Initialize the assistant
assistant = DeepResearchAssistant()

# Perform deep research
results = assistant.research("transformer models for computer vision", max_depth=3)

# Access results
print(results["research_summary"])
```

### Example Script

Run the example script:
```bash
python example_usage.py
```

### Custom Research

```python
# Initialize
assistant = DeepResearchAssistant()

# Your research query
query = "diffusion models for time series forecasting"

# Perform research with custom depth
results = assistant.research(query, max_depth=3)

# Results structure
print(f"Research Summary: {results['research_summary']}")
print(f"Research Depth: {results['research_depth']}")
print(f"Total Sources: {len(results['initial_results'])}")
print(f"Cross-references: {len(results['cross_references'])}")
```

## System Architecture

### LangGraph Workflow

The system uses LangGraph to create a sophisticated research workflow:

```
Initial Search ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Refined Search ‚Üí Cross-Reference ‚Üí Synthesis ‚Üí Follow-up ‚Üí Final Report
```

### State Management

The `ResearchState` maintains context throughout the research process:
- Query and search results
- Refined queries generated by AI
- Cross-reference data
- Synthesis and follow-up questions
- Research metrics and depth tracking

### Search Tools

1. **ArxivSearchTool**: Enhanced arXiv search with better formatting
2. **PapersWithCodeSearchTool**: Find papers with code implementations
3. **GoogleScholarSearchTool**: Academic search 

## Research Process

### 1. Initial Search
- Searches arXiv, PapersWithCode, and Google Scholar
- Collects metadata: title, authors, abstract, URLs, publication dates
- Identifies code repositories and implementations

### 2. Analysis & Refinement
- Uses Gemini to analyze initial results
- Generates 3-5 refined search queries
- Focuses on gaps, recent developments, and related areas

### 3. Refined Search
- Executes refined queries across sources
- Expands research scope based on AI analysis
- Collects additional relevant papers

### 4. Cross-Reference Search
- Identifies papers that cite or are cited by relevant papers
- Builds citation network for deeper understanding
- Finds related research through citation analysis

### 5. Synthesis
- Comprehensive analysis of all findings
- Organizes information into key areas:
  - Research areas identified
  - Recent developments
  - Available implementations
  - Research gaps
  - Methodologies and applications

### 6. Follow-up Generation
- Generates 5-7 follow-up research questions
- Provides 3-5 practical recommendations
- Identifies 2-3 emerging trends

### 7. Final Report
- Professional research report format
- Executive summary and methodology
- Detailed findings and recommendations
- Complete reference list

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key

### Customization Options
- `max_depth`: Control research depth (1-5 levels)
- `max_results`: Number of results per search
- Search sources: Add or modify search tools

## Output Format

The system generates a comprehensive research report including:

- **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of findings
- **Research Methodology**: Sources and search strategy
- **Key Findings**: Main discoveries and insights
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive synthesis
- **Follow-up Research**: Questions and recommendations
- **References**: All relevant papers and sources

## Advantages Over Simple Search

1. **Multi-step Analysis**: Goes beyond simple keyword search
2. **Intelligent Refinement**: Uses AI to generate better search queries
3. **Cross-reference Analysis**: Finds related work through citations
4. **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Combines all findings into coherent analysis
5. **Follow-up Generation**: Suggests next research directions
6. **Professional Output**: Structured research report format

## Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits**: Respects API rate limits for external services
2. **Google Scholar**: Currently a placeholder (needs proper API integration)
3. **Processing Time**: Multi-step research takes several minutes
4. **API Costs**: Uses Google Gemini API for analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Sources**: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library
2. **Citation Analysis**: More sophisticated citation network analysis
3. **Code Analysis**: Analyze GitHub repositories for implementation details
4. **Visualization**: Generate research maps and citation graphs
5. **Custom Models**: Support for other LLM providers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
2. **Import Errors**: Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Rate Limits**: The system includes delays to respect API limits
4. **Network Issues**: Check internet connection for external API calls

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying the logging level in the code:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
